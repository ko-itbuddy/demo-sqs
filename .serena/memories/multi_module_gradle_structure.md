# Multi-Module Gradle Project Structure

## Current Issue
Consumer service fails to start on different PCs despite proper Java 21 and Docker setup. User specifically identified that "settings.gradle이 필요해 보여" (settings.gradle seems to be needed).

## Project Structure
```
demo/
├── producer-service/
│   ├── build.gradle
│   ├── gradlew
│   └── src/
├── consumer-service/
│   ├── build.gradle
│   ├── gradlew
│   └── src/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── scripts/
└── README.md
```

## Missing Component
- **settings.gradle** at project root - Required for multi-module Gradle project configuration
- This file defines the project structure and includes all submodules

## Expected Solution
Create settings.gradle with:
```gradle
rootProject.name = 'demo-sqs'
include 'producer-service'
include 'consumer-service'
```

This will allow Gradle to properly recognize the multi-module structure and resolve dependencies correctly across different environments.

## Environment Validation Needs
- Java 21 compatibility check
- Docker environment verification
- Gradle wrapper consistency
- Port availability validation (8080, 8081, 4566)
